# Candy_Crush_C_Plus_Plus

About the Project : 

This project is a C++ implementation of the backend logic of Candy Crush, built as part of my first semester CS project.
The focus is logic building, not graphics.It simulates how the game works behind the scenes:

i.matching candies
ii.removing matches
iii.dropping candies
iv.refilling the board
v.updating the score

This project helped me understand loops, arrays, conditions, and game logic in a practical way.

Concepts Used :

This project helped me practice:

i.Nested loops
ii.2D arrays
iii.Conditional statements
iv.Functions
v.Random number generation
vi.Logic building & problem solving

Technologies Used :

i.Language: C++
ii.Compiler: g++ / any standard C++ compiler
iii.Environment: Console-based
